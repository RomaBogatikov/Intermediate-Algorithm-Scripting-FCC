Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Sum All Primes
Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. 
For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

The provided number may not be a prime.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

/*
Procedure to find out the prime number:

Suppose A is given number.

Step 1: Find a whole number nearly greater than the square root of A. K Â¿ square root(A) 
Step 2: Test whether A is divisible by any prime number less than K. If yes A is not a prime number. 
If not, A is prime number.
